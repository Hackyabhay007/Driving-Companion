# Driving Companion

Driving Companion is a mobile application designed to enhance driver safety and prevent accidents. The app utilizes machine learning techniques to detect driver drowsiness and provide real-time alerts and tips to keep the driver alert and focused on the road. Additionally, it includes a speed limit notification feature to ensure drivers adhere to legal speed limits and avoid potential accidents.

## Features

### Drowsiness Detection and Alert
- The app uses ML Kit, a machine learning framework provided by Google, to detect driver drowsiness based on eye movements and facial expressions.
- When drowsiness is detected, the app provides real-time alerts to the driver, reminding them to stay focused and avoid potential accidents.
- Tips and suggestions are displayed to help the driver maintain attentiveness and reduce the risk of drowsy driving.

### Speed Limit Notifications
- The app utilizes GPS technology to monitor the vehicle's speed.
- It provides notifications to the driver when they exceed the legal speed limit for the current road.
- By alerting drivers about their speed, the app helps promote safer driving practices and reduces the likelihood of accidents caused by excessive speed.

## Tech Stack

- Programming Languages: Java, XML
- Machine Learning: ML Kit (for drowsiness detection using eye movements)
- Android Development: Android SDK

## Installation

To use the Driving Companion app, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.
4. Grant the necessary permissions for the app to access the device's camera and location (if prompted).
5. Start the app and enable the necessary features (drowsiness detection and speed limit notifications).

## Note

- The app relies on ML Kit's machine learning capabilities to detect drowsiness based on eye movements. It requires a device with a front-facing camera to accurately monitor the driver's eyes.
- The app is intended as a supportive tool to promote safe driving practices. However, it is crucial for drivers to prioritize road safety, remain alert, and avoid distractions while driving.
- The app does not collect or store any personal data without user consent. Privacy and data security are important considerations in the app's development.
